### Reference Model:
- In the crust, we utilize CRUST1.0 ([link](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-crust10/)), and in the mantle, we use STW105 ([link](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-stw105/)) during the inversion process. This approach allows us to focus on updating model perturbations rather than absolute model parameter values. For plotting and final illustration purposes, we employ the EARA2024_AVG, an averaged 1D model derived from EARA2024, which is provided by the "_ref" parameters in the model file.

### Prior Model:
- EARA2014 ([link](https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JB011638))

### Data Set Description:
- We present a new 3-D radially anisotropic seismic velocity model EARA2024 of the crust and mantle beneath East Asia and the northwestern Pacific using adjoint full-waveform inversion tomography. We construct the EARA2024 model by iteratively minimizing the waveform similarity misfit between the synthetic and observed waveforms from 142 earthquakes recorded by about 2,000 broadband stations in East Asia. Compared to previous studies, this new model renders significantly improved images of the subducted oceanic plate in the upper mantle, mantle transition zone, and uppermost lower mantle along the Kuril, Japan, Izu-Bonin, and Ryukyu Trenches. Complex slab deformation and break-offs are observed at different depths. Moreover, our model provides new insights into the origins of intraplate volcanoes in East Asia, including the Changbaishan, Datong-Fengzhen, Tengchong, and Hainan volcanic fields.

**Caption:** Map views of Vs perturbation at various depths. The reference model is the 1-D average of the 3-D model. Regions with low resolution, based on the point spread function resolution test, are masked out. Magenta curves represent the slab depth contour at each depth, based on the Slab2 model (Hayes et al. 2018). The tectonic units and plate boundaries from the NUVEL-1 model (DeMets et al. 1990) are outlined by green curves, and intraplate volcanoes are marked with red triangles.
